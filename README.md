**Broker Trade CSV Organizer & Converter**

sort. is a lightweight web tool that helps individuals organize and standardize broker-provided CSV trade files for easier review and record-keeping.

The application runs entirely with local, in-browser processing.  
Uploaded files are not stored on any server and are removed from memory immediately after processing.

## Why I Built This

I built sort. to solve a real problem I repeatedly ran into while preparing tax documents and organizing transaction data.

Manually cleaning and reformatting broker CSV files—especially when dealing with multiple sources—quickly became time-consuming and error-prone. After hitting the same frustration over and over, I decided to automate the process properly instead of fixing spreadsheets every tax season.

sort. focuses on **data organization and formatting only**.  
It does **not** calculate taxes, determine gains or losses, or provide financial, legal, or tax advice.
